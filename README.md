## Example usage

I recommend trying first an action required a manual action, to test the settings.

```yaml
name: Create toots from JSON Feed items
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  CACHE_DIRECTORY: ".cache"

jobs:
  Mastodon:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js ‚öôÔ∏è
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies üì¶
        run: npm ci

      - name: JSON Feed to Mastodon ü¶£
        uses: nhoizey/github-action-jsonfeed-to-mastodon@v1
        env:
          RUNNER_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY: ${{ runner.temp }}
        with:
          feedUrl: "https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/feeds/mastodon/photos-test.json"
          mastodonInstance: ${{ secrets.TEST_MASTODON_INSTANCE }}
          mastodonToken: ${{ secrets.TEST_MASTODON_TOKEN }}
          cacheDirectory: ${{ env.CACHE_DIRECTORY }}
          globalDelayToots: 1

      - name: Pull any changes üì•
        run: git pull

      - name: Commit and push üì§
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: "chore(cache): update Mastodon cache file (automated)"
          file_pattern: "${{ env.CACHE_DIRECTORY }}/*.json"
          skip_fetch: false
```

You can then enhance your action with a schedule as defined in GitHub's [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).
